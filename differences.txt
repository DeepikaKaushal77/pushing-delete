Difference between trees and a graph:

Both are non linear structures.Tree is a special type of graph.
Tree is hierarchical graph is network. Every node can have only 1 parent. So parent child relation.No such rules apply to graph.
Trees don't have loops but graphs can have.
Trees are directed acyclic graphs.



Difference between trees and a binary tree:
Trees can have any no. of nodes but a binary tree can have atmost 2 nodes.
so binary trees are kind of trees having 0 to 2 children.
Heaps are implemented using almost complete binary trees i.e. n node can have child only when n-1 have both children.



Difference between binary tree and binary search tree:
Binary search tree is a kind of binary tree. It can also have atmost 2 children but all nodes on the left subtree must be lesser than the root node and all nodes on right must be higher than the root node.
